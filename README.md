Tarot Reading:
A github-hosted webpage that can be displayed on a large screen. Displaying a specific tarot card in front of the camera will randomly show an appropriate reading in a manner similar to a game dialog box. I see it as a chance of create a way to play around with my world setting & kind of IP interactive web design. 

Interactive features: check 22 Major Arcana cards, each with random 1-6 options. Four of the cards (The Fool, The World, The Lovers, Death) have hidden options (Branch).
